I have this code which is use C++ STL function lower_bound.
Imagine I have a vector array called arr.
Integer n as the input I'm looking for.
I know lower_bound function returns an iterator pointing to the index of the item if found or the next greater if not found.
I want you to explain to me why I need to subtract arr.begin() from the lower_bound function to get the index?

Here is the code:

// input
int n;
cin >> n;

// Lower Bound
vector<int> arr;
int ind = lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), n) - arr.begin();
